<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<p>My name is Carissa Blossom. Born and raised in Singapore with an Iranian mother and an American father, I'm a proud Third Culture Kid. My main passions in life are learning, creating and travelling. Growing up abroad, travelling to and living in countries with different cultures and environments taught me to love languages, appreciate what I have in life, and to always keep an open perspective.</p>

<p> As a kid, my dream job was to become an inventor. I wanted to create things that would help connect people and address the struggles of those around me. Growing up, my parents taught me that it was my duty was someone with great privilege to give back to those less fortunate than me, and this has always been central to my desire to help and connect with others. </p>

<p>It wasn't until recently that I realized that I could achieve my dream of inventing, helping and creating through computer programming. When I first got into 'computer studies', it was as a high school student in the only computer classes offered at my school: Computer Animation. Working with Maya and Vue became one of my favorite past times (along with reading and tennis), something I continued with for all four years of high school as the only girl in the program. It wasn't until after college that I realized that 'coding' wasn't something reserved for boys who had been hacking computers since they were pre-teens. Once I got into it, I realized that programming represented this amazing culmination of three things I really enjoyed: logic, puzzles and languages.</p>

<p>I'm now a student at Dev Bootcamp with dreams of becoming a software engineer. When I'm not learning to code, I like to spend my time hiking, running, playing tennis, reading or watching science-fiction, or researching more about my other great interest: nutrition &amp; health.</p>
