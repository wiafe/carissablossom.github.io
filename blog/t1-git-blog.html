    <p>
      When I first learned about Version Control and Github, I really REALLY wished that someone had told me about this and shown me how to use this back when I was still in University!
     </p>
     <p>
      Now, I'm not sure what anyone else was doing in University, but with my particular major, I spent the majority of my time writing one research paper or essay after another. I learned pretty early on in my education that the key to a good paper is to LOTS of edits and LOTS of versions. One issue with this was that you either ended up with a folder clogged with files titled _v1 ... _v2 .. _v50, or you ended up saving over old changes and losing them. Personally, I ended up doing some combination of the two. And even if I had meticulously saved each version with a new _v#, it was impossible to remember what bit of information I was trying to add back in was in which version!
     </p>
     <p>
      Git and Git's version control solves EXACTLY this problem. Here's a good definition for git: <i>Git is an open-source version control system that allows developers to track changes throughout the lifetime of a project.</i> Git automatically keeps track of all files as you work on them, and ranks them as:
       <ol>
        <li><b>'untracked'</b> (new files)</li>
        <li><b>'unstaged'</b> (not set up to save)</li>
        <li><b>'staged'</b> (set up to save, but not saved permanently yet)</li>
        <li><b>'committed'</b> (saved).</li>
       </ol>
      To make your life even easier, git commit even allows for an appended <b>message</b> so that you'll remember what you changed between that commit and the one before it.
     </p>
     <p>
      All version control means, is that it keeps track of changes (versions). Why do we care?
      <ol>
      <li> You can see how your work and ideas progressed</li>
      <li> You'll never lose your work (as long as you don't forget to commit!)</li>
      <li> If something goes wrong you can go back to an old, safe version</li>
      <li> If you want to bring something from an old version back, you can find it (via the 'messages') and add it back in (from the old saves) easily.</li>
      <li> Although git itself isn't remote (you'd have to share over a network or something), it does lend itself well to working with groups. Two people can work on something at the same time and then MERGE their work onto the master file, rather than one person overwriting all the hard work of the second by mistake (well, we HOPE it was a mistake...)</li>
      </ol>
     </p>
     <p>
      It's with point #5 where GitHub really shines. Github is a <b>remote</b> entity to and from which you can upload ('push') or download ('pull') files and folders that would otherwise only exist locally on someone's computer. It has become an online hub for programmers to share code remotely so that they can collaborate with other coders all over the world at the same time!
     </p>
     <p>
      Github has all the benefits of dropbox, plus many more. It allows you to upload all your files to a 'cloud' so you can access them anywhere at anytime as long as you can an internet connection. The bonus from Github on this particular front is that there is NO limit as to how much you can put up there!
     </p>
     <p>
      Github then proceeds to leave dropbox completely in its dust. It provides the same Version Control that makes git so useful and popular, but is more straight forward and user friendly. You can download files from Github onto your computer without having any knowledge of the shell/terminal at all.
     </p>
     <p>
      I would love to see this amazing software see use outside of the programming world, so that poor researchers searching through all 15 versions of their research paper, or that college student panicking because he mistakenly cleared his essay document and then saved it (I can't be the only one to have done that!) can take advantage of a MUCH more advanced and useful software.
     </p>
     <p>
      Dropbox, you can collect dust in my attic.
