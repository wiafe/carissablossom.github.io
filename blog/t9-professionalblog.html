  <section>
    <p> I'm a perfectionist by nature. In every area of my life, I'm constantly thinking about how to do better. While there are certainly areas of my life where I am actively working on shutting down that perfectionist side of my brain, within the context of designing my personal website, I'm very glad for that inner perfectionist.</p>

    <p>While we've been in school, my blog has undergone four separate, complete design re-dos. Considering we've been in school for nine weeks, that strikes me as quite a lot. However, with each iteration I learn more about designing a website, what works and what doesn't.</p>

    <p>Some of the most important lessons I've learned during this ongoing redesign process were to
    <ul>
      <li>Pay attention to image choice.</li>
      <li>Choose a good color pallete that 'pops' and also matches the images.</li>
      <li>Think about where the eye is drawn and what you want to place there.</li>
      <li>Whitespace is good space, but to be careful not to get so basic it's boring. Even whitespace needs design!</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
    I think, in a way, my experience with redesigning my own website really helped me understand the concept of Agile Development better. In this case, I was both designer and client, which should have made it easy to anticipate my own likes and aspirations for the site. However, even with all the mood-boarding and wireframing I had done, it wasn't until I finished a design version and took a look at it that I really knew if I liked it or not, and even then, I might implement the design over more pages only to realize that it didn't work anymore.
    </p>
    <p>One of the best pieces of advice I got when I sent out my site for feedback was to go back and do some more mood boarding, and to go on Pinterest under UI Design and keep looking at site designs. As I looked through the designs, I tried to ask myself <i>What is is about these sites that I'm picking out that made me choose them? What works? What do I like?</i> More often that not, I found that I was attracted to a heavy use of imagery while still keeping text clear, and bright colors within a limited (not overwhelming) color palette.</p>
    <p>Another key piece of advice was to pick my color pallette from my home page picture, but to make sure I chose a color from within the picture that 'popped' and was pleasing to the eye. Originally, I had picked a mild green color, which several people suggested I change for something brighter and happier that gave greater contrast between foreground and background colors.</p>
    <p>I'm happy with the way my site has developed, and very grateful for all the amazing feedback I recieved which proved vital to improving my site. I still have a lot more work to do before I address all the great suggestions that I want to implement. For instance, the copy on my About Me section needs greater detail, a more present focus, and to better address the needs of my target audience (prospective employers, for instance). However, I really need to work on better time management. I was lucky that, as this is the last week in Phase 0, we have had very little work, so I could easily spend 2 days doing nothing but fixing my website without issue. However, in the future as I continue to improve my site, I need to make sure that I timebox and include more frequent, but shorter time periods. Instead of spending huge amounts of time every two weeks, I should put in a couple of hours every week or biweekly, as needed.</p>
    <p>It's still amazing to think that I can now build a professional looking website! I look back on where I was nine weeks ago, when the concept of understanding all that code behind a website was a foreign and daunting task, and I feel so grateful to DBC for teaching me this skill. Being able to build a website, from scratch without a template, is a key skill that I'm sure will not go to waste. </p>
