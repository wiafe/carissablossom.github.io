  <h1>The Problem with Passwords</h1>
  <h2>It's just a string of characters between hackers and all our private information</h2>
  <h4>Cultural Post #3</h4>

<!--PARAGRAPHS HERE-->

      <!--Your first paragraph goes here.-->
      Your email, your bank account, your facebook. From these three sources alone, someone could easily access your financial funds, find out who you are, where you live, when you were born...the list of personal, private information that we keep on the web goes on and on. In most cases, there's only one thing standing between a stranger and all that data: YOUR PASSWORD. It's a crazy string of letters, numbers and symbols that has to be memorable to us but complicated enough that it's not immediately obvious. Yet, even with the most complex of passwords, is that string of characters really keeping our information safe?

    </p>

    <p>
        <!--Your second paragraph goes here.-->
        In 2012, WIRED wrote an article which clearly announced: "No matter how complex, no matter how unique, <strong>your passwords can no longer protect you</strong>". Yet, three years later, I'm still using a password for my facebook, my email, my bank account, my apple account, the list goes on. If anything, the list might have gotten longer and a bit more concerning. Nowadays, I can sign in or sign up for all sorts of apps that store all sorts of personal information without having to pick a new username or password at all! They'll just use my google or facebook to log me in. As efficient as that is, that just means that whoever manages to hack my email address, now has access to even more information than they did back in 2012.

    </p>

        <!--Your third paragraph goes here.-->
        When you think about it, it's terrifyingly easy to access someone's password. We're all very grateful for that 'forgot password?' icon, especially now that we're making these ridiculously complicated passwords to try and make it harder for people to hack. As Mat explains in his 2012 Wired article, it often takes only the answers to a couple simple questions about the person to gain access to your email account. The questions we have to choose from for our emails are often laugahbly easy, open information. Try googling yourself, and see just how much of your life appears on the internet. Try using that google search to find out the info you need for those basic questions. How hard do you think it really is for a determined person to find out your mother's maiden name, or the city you were born? And once they reset and gain access to your email address, they can easily use that 'forgot password' button to reset and access all of your other accounts through your email! I don't know about you, but I'm hoping that there is a better solution out there than simply going 'off-grid', keeping any semblance of personal information off the web.

        <!--Your fourth paragraph goes here.-->
         There have been some advancements, steps that are being taken to begin addressing this security issue. Firstly, two-factor authentication is being pushed by companies like Twitter and Gmail as a way to add extra security. Basically, what this means is that some kind of secondary form of authentication is needed to gain access. This secondary form can be a cell phone or some physical device, but either way, the devices recieve (or produce) a computer generated code that usually has to be entered back into your computer or mobile device along with your password. This is definitely a good start, yet it is not yet used by enough companies with a great enough frequency to be truly effective. Because such a large majority of our accounts are linked, we need all of these companies to adopt the higher security measures, otherwise it becomes too easy to access the more secure site via the less secure one.

    </p>

      Another measure that I think would help improve efficiency would be greater surveilance and viligance on the part of these companies holding so much of our personal data. Just like how your bank notifies you of unusual activity, or activity in an unusual or foreign location, it would definitely improve security if were were notified of unusual activity for all of our other accounts holding personal, private information. The fact of the matter is, companies like google are already reading and using our email content for their own purposes (namely, selling them to companies for advertising & marketing information). In my opinion, if they are going to use this information anyways, I'd rather they also use it to ensure greater security for my information, using high security measures for every login, notifying me of logins from new devices, and screening for unusual activity/abnormal behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a lot of ways, it seems like we are moving to a world of greater transparency, when all of our personal information is so readily available and accessible that the very concept of 'personal' changes. That said, there are certain things I would certainly like to keep to myself and seeing as I have no intention of going off-grid, I'm looking to tech companies and their innovative solutions to keep my information safe. </p>
