      It's easy to talk about conflicts where you were in the right, but it's harder to talk about those where you were wrong and you handled it badly. I think it's harder to talk about these because, even after it is resolved, there is always that remaining guilt and/or shame at handly it badly, and the resulting blow to your ego. However, I think having these kind of mistakes are important and healthy, because you learn and grow a lot more from these experiences than ones where you were in the right.

    In my last job, I was given charge of a section of the business at the startup I was working for. It was only my second job, and a big jump from my last job where I was just handling business development in a lower level managerial position. This new job was in Thailand, and I was a 24 year old kid from a different culture who was in charge of a large team of workers. Most of them were decades my senior and didn't even speak the same language as I did. Regardless of who was formally in charge (aka me), they looked to the operations executive, who also happened to be one of the most senior on the team age-wise and also the village elder. He was someone I really respected, and who was in many ways my mentor.

    An american team was going to be coming to our factory for the first time to make sure we were up to standard. If we failed, we have to fix all the issues and then reapply, and we would miss our customer's deadline, one that we had already had to postpone twice. We weren't sure that they would accept a third delay. It was succeed or lose the deal. Naturally, this was a high stress scenario for all involved, and everybody was doing their best to ensure success. It was my job, as project leader, to make sure that everything went smoothly. When I came to the facility two days before the inspection to make sure we were prepared, I discovered we were FAR from it. If the inspector had arrived that day, we would have failed. I panicked. I was frustrated, and a bit angry. I had put a lot of time and effort into this project, and had painstakingly gone through each point that needed to be taken care of with the factory managers. </p>

    <p>
    I called a meeting with my mentor, who was on the ground 100% of the time supervising and making sure everything actually happened (while I was mainly in Bangkok at the commercial office and came in once a week). In my head, I was sharing with him the dire nature of the scenario, and talking about what needed to be fixed. However, in my frustration, I made him feel like HE was the one who had failed, and he took it as a personal affront. </p>
    <p>
      I may have been in charge now, but he had been running things for over 40 years, and he was the one who was on the ground all the time not me. I may have known more about certain requirements for this product, but he knew the greater industry and had been meeting with these kinds of inspectors for a long time. From his standpoint, it was undoubtedly frustrating and disrespectful for a young kid to tell him what was wrong and how to run HIS factory. This was definitely exacerbated by the fact that we were in a country where criticism in any form is generally avoided, and there is a very large emphasis on respect for the elders. </p>

      <p>Had I been paying attention, instead of being wrapped in my own emotions and goals, I would have probably noticed that he was upset during the conversation. The ideal scenario would have definitely involved me handling the conversation better, but even if I had realized it halfway through or right after and immediately apologized, it probably would have been better. Instead, I heard about it a week later from my superior, who told me that he had spoken to the man, who now didn't want to work with me. I was surprised and ashamed, because I had hurt someone who I really looked up to, and whose opinion meant a lot to me, and not realizing it had led to a loss of face for both me and the superior who had taken a chance on me.
    </p>

    <p>
        <!--Your fourth paragraph goes here.-->
      I took the night to stew over my emotions, and to think about what happened and what I could have done differently, then called my mentor the next day to apologize. I wanted him to know that I recognized that my behavior was inexcusable, and that he was someone I really admired and respected. While he gracefully accepted my apology and we continued to work together, I realized that I had to prove to him that I did respect him and change my behavior in general. From that day on, in my own head, I stopped viewing myself as the 'leader', and started thinking of myself as the person who ran the commercial side of things. I made greater efforts to show that his opinion was always considered and respected. I paid closer attention to how other people within the office behaved around him, and noticed that regardless of their position in the company, nobody ever forget that he was the village elder. I let him hold the spotlight, and let him take formal credit for things we discussed together. This seemed to give more power to decisions we made.
    </p>

    <p> If I could go back, I would meet with my mentor, and ask him what HE thought. Were we ready for inspections? Rather than me TELLING him or talking at him, I should have been going to him for advice on whether my concerns were valid, and how he would move to change it. I would have then summarized our conversation and shared it with my superior. If my superior then wanted to discuss further measures, it would be coming from someone who my mentor was comfortable receiving such suggestions from instead of a young newbie. </p>

    <p>
    More than anything, I think this showed me how I still need to really work on become a more humble person. I am generally a very connected and empathetic person, but I can be too assertive, and tend to push my ideas and opinions on people too hard. Although it's still a point of shame, I am grateful, in a way, that this happened to me, because it's always in the back of my head, a reminder of how I don't want to act. It keeps me from speaking out when I'm frustrated, and prompts me to think carefully about what I want to say and how, if at all, to say it. It prompts me to be sensitive to the perspective of those I am working with or talking to, and to always respect them, and honor their perspectives.
    I learned a lot from my mentor, but it may have been through this conflict that I learned the most important of his lessons. </p>
