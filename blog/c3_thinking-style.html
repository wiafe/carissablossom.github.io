    <p id="aboutbody">I'm a San Francisco based student at Dev Bootcamp with dreams of becoming a software developer. I was born and raised in Singapore. Besides programming and all things techie, I'm passionate about health, fitness, travel and sci-fi. I'm proud to call myself a marathoner, mountain climber and TKD blackbelt. I dream of one day combining my three main passions, tech, health and fitness, to create something awesome!</p></div>

<!--PARAGRAPHS HERE-->
  <section>
    <p>
      <!--Your first paragraph goes here.-->
      As part of our Dev Bootcamp experience, we were asked to take a quiz to determine our Gregoric Thinking Style. The Gregori Thinking Style defines four categories: Concrete Sequential, Abstract Sequential, Concrete Random and Abstract Random.While all four thinking styles describe us to some degree, we all tend to have one that is dominant.

    </p>

    <p>
        <!--Your second paragraph goes here.-->
        For me, my dominant thinking style is Abstract Sequential. Abstract refers to my perceptual quality, and means that I prefer and rely heavily on my intuiting and imagination, and look beyond 'what is' to the more subtle implications. Abstract perception allows you to visualize, concieve ideas, and to understand and believe what I can't see. This doesnt mean that I don't deal with the 'here and now', but instead that I have an natural strength in the abstract.
    </p>

    <p>
        <!--Your third paragraph goes here.-->
        Sequential refers to how I organize information. As a sequential thinker, I like to organize information in a linear, step by step fashion. It also suggests a preference for planning and maintaining a logical thought process.
    </p>

    <p>
        <!--Your fourth paragraph goes here.-->
        There are two different areas fo value that I can immediately look at and apply to my Dev Bootcamp experience. Firstly, each thinking style is given a list of things that are 'challenging', or do not come easily for them. I think it's important, as believers of the growth mindset, to note that just because we have a certain thinking style, this doesn't mean that we are bound to always find the same things challenging! That said, here are some things from the list of AS challenges that I think are areas I am and need to continue to work on:
        <ul>
          <li>Dealing with people with radically different views</li>
          <li>Lots of specific rules & regulations</li>
          <li>Being diplomatic</li>
          <li>not monopolizing conversation</li>
        </ul>
        I have always found that I do better when I am around a group of people who share my core values and passions. This certainly doesn't mean that I need to be surrounded with people who share the same perspective as me. I actually enjoy exploring other persectives. However, I feel like I need to work on being more accepting of those whose base assumptions in life differ from mine.
        </p>

        <p>
         I think this is something that I may have the opportunity to learn at DBC. Although the people I have been surrounded with so far have undoubtedly shared my passion for learning, I may eventually have to pair with someone who has other reasons for joining the school, and may not want to put the same degree of time, effort and energy into the assignment as I do! Similarly, I have already found myself conscious of and actively working on monopolizing conversation less, and being more aware of how I say things or how it may come across to other people. Having to pair with people multiple times a week, and getting feedback both from my fellow students and guides will help me to practice, and assess whether or not I am improving!

    </p>

    <p>
        <!--Your fifth paragraph goes here.-->
        I think my biggest challenge so far has been in situations where I feel like I know more than my partner, and I automatically jump in and take charge, over-monopolizing the conversation. I really want to work on spending less time showing others what I know, and more time listening to their perspectives, thought processes and discoveries. I'm hoping that by being open with my classmates about what it is that I have a tendency towards, and what I am trying to work on, they will help me to take note of when I 'slip up', and where I could be better, and when I did well.
    </p>

    <p>
        <!--Your fourth paragraph goes here.-->
        Now, our thinking style tells us about more than just where we are weak, it also tells us under what conditions we really prosper! For me, being in a stimulating environment with access to experts and references is definitely key. It's for this reason that I have always LOVED being in the school setting. I like to be challenged, and to be around people who really understand the area I am trying to learn. It's important for me to be in a creative, open, passionate atmosphere. I think one of the reasons that I am enjoying DBC so much is because this truly describes the school: it's an open, creative space full of amazing teachers and students willing to share what they know, and as long as you are willing to put in the hard work and grab at whatever resources are within your grasp, the sky is the limit!
