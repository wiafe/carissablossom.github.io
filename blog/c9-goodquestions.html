  <section>
    <p>One of the things DBC tries to teach you is how to be a great, lifelong student. An essential part of being a student is asking good, clear questions. Remember the saying <cite>There's no such thing as a bad question</cite>? I'd like to revise it. <i>There are no such things as bad questions, just badly presented ones.</i></p>

    <p>When you think about a question, it's important to:
      <ol>
        <li>Set context: what was the <b>situation/scenario</b> where the issue emerged?</li>
        <li><b>What &amp; where</b> was the issue? <b>When</b> did the issue appear?</li>
        <li>The code, with just enough context (or illustration of the issue if it's not code)</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p><b>Context- </b> context is vital to a good question because it explains the situation in which the problem took place. Without context, the specific problem at hand is not clear, and the answer may have to do with solving the problem in a completely different scenario or in broader terms than what you are actually looking for.In the context of coding, the situation or scenario involves explaining what you were working on, what you were taking as input (if any), and what you were trying to do. Context can be tricky, because you need to provide enough context that the person could replicate the scenario you are discussing without missing bits of information that would make it impossible to work, but keeping certain information vague or leaving it out if it isnt necessary and is giving away private project details.</p>
    <p><b>Time &amp; Place-</b> the 'what' and 'when' are important to any question or problem. 'Why do I get dizzy' could lead to a host of answers, so let's give it some <b>context</b>: 'when I'm playing tennis', and then our <b>time and place</b>'at noon in the summer'. The more specific you get, the more tailored the answer will be to your specific problem at hand. Without specificity, you may complain that the answers you are getting are 'wrong' or don't work, when in reality, the answer is true but not for you! In the context of coding, explaining when an error/bug popped up and at what point in the code, where the code started to deviate from what you wanted it to do, etc are all time and place information that make it easier for someone to help explain may have gone wrong with your code. If you are trying to find out how to do something, time and place information is still useful, it helps provide greater clarity for when and where you plan to implement the code that you are trying to learn to write.</p>
    <p><b>Code- </b> even with the most detailed scenario in the world, and all the what/where/when information you could possibly provide, a question is better when you show your work. If a student goes to their tutor with a question about a specific math problem and what they tried to do but doesn't bring the worksheet with the problem and their attempted answer on it, it can be hard for the tutor to effectively help the student. We're asking for help because we have run into problems, we can't catch an error, we are missing information, or we don't know how to do something. In these cases, our description of the problem isn't as effective as the showing the actual work becuase there may be things we overlook or don't know is important, that someone else looking at our work will spot. These forgotten pieces are, in many cases, key to resolving our issues.</p>
    <p>Finally, after you have provided sufficient information, provided your code or work to go along with the situation, you finally get to the QUESTION itself, which you should think of as the TITLE of your little piece of work. This comes last because it's a summary of the situation, the work and the issue. It says, given all of that, THIS is what I want to know, what I am struggling with and need help understanding. Try to phrase it as a question, instead of a statement. If you can't phrase it as a question, you need to go back and look at your context, because you probably haven't provided enough information yet.</p>
    <p>Interestingly, you might even find that in the process of laying out the context, the time and place and the code itself, you might spot the answer to your problem yourself before you ever get about posting that question!</p>
