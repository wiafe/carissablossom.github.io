      The key reason I have fallen hard and fast for the Dev Bootcamp experience is not so much related to the one hour intro chat, or even the readings, although I found both to be very interesting, but the dynamic between the newly formed student body.

      None of us have met in person, and regardless of how much experience we had with the various programming languages or ‘tech industry’ in the past, we are all starting out on a completely new experience. Yet, the group has been nothing but excited to learn and eager to share. I’m not sure if it was the admissions process, but it seems to me like the whole group was already on board with this ‘kitchen’ mindset long before we were told there was an option of table or kitchen.

      This emphasis on getting messy, sharing your ignorance, reaching out to others and LEARNING TO LEARN was what really sold me on Dev Bootcamp in the first place, back when I was choosing a ‘hack school’ to attend. I’m really excited to see that it’s more than just an admissions pitch.

      I have very little background in computer programming and coding, but I know I’m personally HUNGRY to get in there and use whatever resources I can get my hands on to learn as much as possible. I’m quickly realising that every single person I interact with is a teacher, and if you reach out for what they know  (and give back by sharing what you do), then the possibilities might just be limitless.

      This has me thinking about what I could accomplish if I apply this same concept, treating everyone I meet as a teacher, to the rest of my life!
