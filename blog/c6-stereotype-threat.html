      <!--Your first paragraph goes here.-->
      This week, we've been asked to talk about Impostor Syndrome and Stereotype Threat. To my understanding, Stereotype Threat refers to 'subconscious self-handicapping', or "the threat of being viewed through the lens of a negative stereotype or the fear of doing something that would inadvertently confirm that stereotype". Impostor Syndrome is defined as "a collection of feelings of inadequacy that persist even in face of information that indicates that the opposite is true. It is experienced internally as chronic self-doubt, and feelings of intellectual fraudulence." These two concepts circle around socially formed stereotypes, and the natural human propensity to judge and organize.
    </p>
      <p>
      In my opinion, judgement is impossible to avoid. The minute we see a person (or anything else, for that matter), we use our pre-existing knowledge from both personal experience, books and other knowledge sources, or second-hand accounts of others to form an initial opinion about whatever it is we are encountering. Whether or not we choose to put aside that initial opinion or adjust it as interact with that person is up to us, but there's no way to avoid that initial split second judgement.
    </p>
      <p>
      Some groups have worse stereotypes associated with them than others, which makes meeting people particularly daunting to think about. No matter how amazing of a person you may be, if you come from a group with a particularly nasty set of stereotypes attached, you are often going to have to
      work twice as hard just to get viewed in the same way (and often with the same level of respect) as someone from another social group.
    </p>
      <p>
      To most people who meet me, I look like someone who shouldn't have an idea about what Impostor Syndrome or Stereotype Threat is like. For starters, I'm white. I also would be considered 'upper-class' socio-economically. I didn't have to worry about how I was going to pay for college, or whether I could study abroad. I had the freedom to try different roles after graduating and to work for a social enterprise without pay because I didn't have to worry about saving up money to pay for student loans, or to ensure that I could help support my parents either now or in the future. I've also travelled to and lived in more countries in my short 24 years than most people will visit in their entire lives. In short, I look like the gleaming statue for white privilege.
      </p>
      <p>
      However, the concept of Impostor Syndrome and Stereotype Threat is something that evokes really strong emotions in me, and something I actually feel that I can understand quite well. That said, none of the experiences in my life, however unpleasant or dramatic, ever made me lose sight of the fact that my life is truly blessed, I came from a place of privilege, and most people would kill for the opportunities that were placed in my lap.
    </p>
      <p>
     There are two areas where I really struggle with Impostor Syndrome. The first is related to my nationality.
   </p>
     <p>
     Meeting new people always comes with this underlying anxiety that I still can't quite shake. It all starts with the dreaded question 'Where are you from?'. When I'm outside of the US, it's not that bad because 'America' usually suffices as an answer, and people usually don't want to know more. I look American, I sound American, American is the answer they expect and they are happy when I reaffirm that initial split second judgement they formed about me. Frankly, if you check my passport, you'll see 'United States of America' printed proudly on its cover, and I am very proud to be holding an American passport. But while I am American, when I say that I am <strong>from</strong>America, it feels like a giant lie, and stirs up feelings of discomfort and shame. I grew up in Singapore. It's I was born, where my parents met, and where I went to school until my parents sent me to boarding school at 14. Even then, I may have been schooling in the US, but I did so as an international student who went home to her parents in Singapore twice a year. I'm proud to be an American, but I'm also extremely proud to be a Singaporean. In my opinion, I shouldn't have to choose, or explain why I don't look Chinese, or why my English is so good (English is the first language there) or if I've even been whipped/chewed gum. Of course, I don't get thrown into this conversation every time I meet someone, but the attention itself makes me uncomfortable and these questions pop up often enough that it has become something I want to avoid. To escape all this, I end up telling people I am American, and naming an American city (whichever one I know enough about to reasonably pull off) as my hometown.
   </p>
     <p>
     Somewhere in the midst of this, I found myself paying way too much attention to how I was acting with people. Was I acting too asian or foreign? If I missed a pop culture reference from pre-2004, it was attributed to my 'Singaporean-ness', even though there are probably tons of kids raised in the US who would may have missed out on whatever it was. When I expressed a political view that was a little different, it was attributed to my Asian upbringing. It's perfectly normal to reminisce about your childhood and share stories with friends, but because my upbringing was different, referring to something from back in Singapore just seemed to highlight my differences. I got stuck in a personal crisis, was I bringing up stuff from home to perpetuate this view people had of me as 'the white Asian'? Did I even count as an Asian? Did I deserve to be considered an American or a Singaporean? A lot of the time, it started to feel like I belonged in neither category. It's a feeling I'm sure that a lot of Third Culture Kids can relate to, and probably why so many TCKs tend to stick to their families or other TCKs. Just as with other groups struggling with their identity versus the identity society tries to force upon you, sometimes you just want to be around people who are like you, sometimes it's just easier that way.
   </p>
     <p>
     A second struggle for me is related to my priviledged life. Do I deserve credit for any of my achievements? I may have gone to a top boarding school, but it was the same school my father went to. Did I get in because of me, or because of my dad? I also followed in my father's footsteps to Colgate University. Wanting desperately to avoid having ask myself if I got in of my own merit or because of my father's, I had only applied there as a 'safety school', incase I didn't get in anywhere else. An invitation to a special program for global leaders changed my mind, and I ended up turning down other admissions in favor of Colgate. Even though I knew I had gone beyond my father by getting into the scholar program, in the back of my head, that little voice kept whispering that I really hadn't achieved anything on my own. After college, my first job was through a family connection, and that little voice in my head got a little more ammo proving I had never done anything of value on my own. My resume looked pretty impressive. Honors in high school, magna cum laude in college as a benton scholar and pi sigma alpha political science honors society inductee, and a nice promotion after a year at work. However, I always felt like these achievements weren't something I really deserved credit for, they were just my own attempts to prove to that little voice in my head that I could still achieve something despite all those advantages I got through my parents. When you've been given every opportunity and every advantage to succeed, doing well doesn't feel like an accomplishment. It just feels like the expected result. Anything less would be an embarrassment considering how much of easier things were for me.
   </p>
     <p>
     I probably sound like a bit of a headcase who needs to put down the violin and end the pity party. And I think that sounds about right! I'm lucky to have parents who were never afraid to tell me what I needed to hear (even if it wasn't what I WANTED to hear), and to push me to be a stronger, better person. I'm lucky to have a younger sister who I can look up to for who I want to be and how I want to handle these challenges. She also grew up with the same challenges,trying to fit in and come to terms with our dual identity, and trying to earn and take pride in our achievements despite privilege, yet she handles her identity with pride and grace, and her achievements are ones she humbly takes pride in, that nobody could doubt are her own.
      </p>
     <p>
     I look to these strong people in my life as examples of who I want to be, and remind myself that the thing about Stereotype Threat and Imposter Syndrome is that we let is happen to ourselves and it's in our own head. Other people can make whatever judgements about us that they like, but it's up to us to be the stronger person who knows who he or she is and takes pride in that, without letting other people dictate who she/he is and what they deserve. I'm definitely not there yet, but I'm working on it. I'm trying to use my own experiences with these challenges to put aside any judgements I may form about the people I meet and help them to be proud of who they are as an individual, regardless of what category or stereotypes may surround them.
