    <p id="aboutbody">I'm a San Francisco based student at Dev Bootcamp with dreams of becoming a software developer. I was born and raised in Singapore. Besides programming and all things techie, I'm passionate about health, fitness, travel and sci-fi. I'm proud to call myself a marathoner, mountain climber and TKD blackbelt. I dream of one day combining my three main passions, tech, health and fitness, to create something awesome!</p></div>

<!--PARAGRAPHS HERE-->
  <section>
    <p>
      <!--Your first paragraph goes here.-->
      This week, we are supposed to talk about what it's been like to pair with other students, and what our reactions were to the feedback they gave us on Socrates.


    </p>

    <p>
        <!--Your second paragraph goes here.-->
        First of all, pairing has really been my favorite part of DBC so far. The guides are only there for one hour per week, and even in those guided pairing sessions, most of the guides don't offer up very much knowledge or input. At least, not like the other students do. In the 5 weeks I have spent at DBC so far, it has been the student pairing that I have gained the most from.
    </p>

    <p>
        <!--Your third paragraph goes here.-->
        Perhaps it is just the kind of people that choose to do this kind of program, or maybe it has to do with the kind of people DBC accepts into its program, but I have found all my pairing partners to be really excited and passionate about the material we are covering, and about learning in general. Some may be more quiet and humble about their knowledge, and others outwardly passionate and eager to share, but I find that I learn a lot from both groups. The first group reminds me to be humble, to speak less about what I learned and spend more time listening to what my partner has learned. The second group are often the ones who teach you the shortcuts, the tricks and are happy to stop and teach about an area they know well. Their outward enthusiasm is contageous. I'm a fan of both groups, and I'm really glad that I have gotten to pair with all kinds of people, from different backgrounds, perspectives and levels of knowledge.
    </p>

    <p> I think the hardest part of this whole process was having to give feedback to others. We are supposed to include a paragraph of constructive critcism, or how they can improve. I was never really sure what I was supposed to say for this. I've never had a partner that didnt seem to be doing their best, or one that seemed dramatically far behind whatever we were expected to know for that week. I've also never had a partner who was rude, unkind, dimissive or disrespectful. Other than one or two people who I felt needed to believe more in themselves and to really see how much they had accomplished already, I didn't know what points of improvement I was supposed to offer people. Most of the time, I just wanted to thank them for working with me, listening to me and teaching me... and maybe give a little 'fist pump' for making through another week!
    </p>


    <p>
    <!--Your fourth paragraph goes here.-->
    I have always been an analytial and introspective person. I am lucky to come from a family that is always trying to help me grow to be a better person. They were never afraid to point out my flaws, and let me know where I could improve, both in terms of my skills and also my personality. I therefore had a pretty good idea coming into the program of what I needed to work on. In a way, getting feedback on a weekly basis in an safe, open environment where I could really work on these flaws I know I have is perfect for me. As I read through my feedback, I can see where I am getting better, and where I still need work.
    </p>

    <p>For me, I know that I need to learn to talk less and listen more, to be more humble and more patient, and to not always step into the role of a leader. I'm a passionate person, and some people may appreciate that, but I can come on too strong. My feedback seems to suggest that I am learning and getting better at some of this. A lot of it seems to suggest I am patient with my partners, so I'm getting better in at least one regard! Other feedback suggests that my passion is still coming out too strong, and I still need to reign it in further, become more humble and spend more time listening, letting others take the lead. I'm definitely grateful for the constant feedback. It's the only way we know if our attempts at improvement are working or not!
