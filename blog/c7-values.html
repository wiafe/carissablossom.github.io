      <!--Your first paragraph goes here.-->
      In my last cultural post, I discussed my experience with Stereotype threat, first as a Third Culture Kid, and second as a person with privilege. I look and sound like (my American accent is suprisingly strong given that I've only spent 8 years living in the country) a typical priviledged white kid. Some people might not recognize its existence, but there are definitely stereotypes and expectations associated with being a white American (or just an American for that matter). You are expected to understand certain pop culture references, hold certain political views, use certain slang, and even vacation in certain places. There will always be those who resent you for your differences. People get very comfortable in their beliefs, and can react in a hostile manner when they meet someone who really challenges those assumptions that they operate on.

    </p>

    <p>
        <!--Your second paragraph goes here.-->
        Being around new people used to be a point of stress for me. Where do I say I am from? More times than I could remember, people would get upset that I said I was from Singapore. Who cares that you were born, raised and educated there?! You can only have ONE nationality, and it's based on what is written on the front of your passport. They found it especially reprehensible to meet someone with an American passport who didn't introduce themselves 100% of the time as an American. </p>
<p>
        Then there are the awkward questions that even the most polite person would WANT to ask, but be unsure how to ask in a politically correct manner:
        'If you're from Singapore, why aren't you Chinese?', 'Why do you speak English so well with such a strong American accent?'. Sometimes, I would also get the occasional curious individual who would humbly ask 'Is that a country? Where the heck is that place? Is that a city in the US?'. </p>
<p>
        Even once we got past these initial awkward moments, my struggle to balance the stereotypes associated with the group I appeared to fit in and those associated with the part of the world I grew up in continued to cause trouble. It's natural for people to talk about stories in their past. We use these to connect with our peers, and to share more of ourselves with our friends. While a lot of my American friends were talking about summers in Martha's Vineyard or Cape Cod, my summers had been spent in Brisbane, Beijing or Bali. For a Singaporean, a summer vacation to Brisbane or a long weekend in Bali is normal holiday. For an American, these were far away, glamorous destinations. My stories were seen as bragging, not sharing, and I learned over time not to share too much until I was sure I was speaking with someone who wouldn't hold it against me.  </p>
    </p>

    <p>
        <!--Your third paragraph goes here.-->
        I have long since moved past the days when I thought too hard about how to introduce myself, kept large parts of myself hidden, and instead reshaped my store to fit the steroetype and the story they WANTED to hear. I introduced myself as from 'New York' or 'South Carolina', kept foreign stories to a minimum or reformatted them into school abroad trip. It worked, people liked me. But I wasn't happy with myself, and had trouble letting any of these people get close to me because none of them really knew who I was. It eventually got old, I got tired of pretending to be someone I was not. </p>
        <p>
        Nowadays, I am unabashed about who I am and where I am from. I think we let these Stereotype Threats get to us not only because they are being by others but because we reinforce them ourselves.
        Yes. My story is different. My views and experiences don't fit what you would expect from the east-coast priviledged white American that I appear to me at first sight. It's something I am proud of. I understand both the culture I grew up in and the group I am 'supposed' to belong to, and this means I get to enjoy and appreciate BOTH. People will always have their prejudices but that doesn't mean that you have to mould yourselves to make them more comfortable or to better fit their views. </p>
        <p>
        Once I became more proud and comfortable with myself and my identity, I became far less afraid of all those initial questions I tend to get asked. For those who ask with an open and curious mind, I'm happy to show them my world and my perspective and to learn more about theirs. It's all about how I react and how I say certain things. If I remain humble and don't get offended about how little they know about my home, people usually turn out to be curious and receptive. I can help take something exotic or different and help explain it from a perspective they can understand. This has made me view my situation as a real gift, one which has come in handy both in personal and work relations. My ability to connect and bond people of different cultures and perspectives is something I am proud of.</p>
        <p>
         I've realized that just as I am very different form the stereotypical group people try to force me into, there are many others who are much more than they appear. It's only through an open mind and a positive, welcoming attitude that you can really get to know who someone is. </p>

          <p>
        <!--Your fourth paragraph goes here.-->
        My goal for the future is to be both as HUMBLE and as PROUD of myself, my heritage, my upbringing and my achievements as possible. When you are truly comfortable with who you are, you don't need to show it off OR hide it. You can share your perspective, and help reshape the stereotypes you are associated with, but only if you treat those you are talking to with respect, and accept that they are acting based on waht they know. You can't hold that against them, only help to broaden their view for the next person like you that they may encounter.
    </p>

         <p>
         Yes, there will always be those who still tell me I can't call myself a Singaporean. There will be those who will call me 'unAmerican', because some of my experiences living abroad make me think that sometimes the American system or so-called 'American way' is not always the best, and could stand to learn something from how other countries (even ones we consider to be 'developing or underdeveloped') do things. There may have once been a point in time where upbringings like mine were limited only to the children of ambassadors or military brats, but that has long since ceased to be the case. </p>
         <p>
         Third Culture Kids are everywhere, and the concept of nationality will HAVE to change to fit this new generation which no longer looks at the question 'Where are you from?' in the same way. We are going to have to broaden our minds, and stop trying to fit people into a singular box when we try to 'define' them. The best way, in my opinion, to make this happen is at an individual level, through ACCEPTANCE both of who we are, and APPRECIATION of the stories of others, no matter how different they might be.
